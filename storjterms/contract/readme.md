# Storage contract

A storage contract defines obligations between farmer and renter.


## Contract rules

 * A contract is valid (not complete) if it matches the [schema](schema.json).
 * A contract is complete if all fields are filled (not `null`).
 * The signatures cover all fields excluding signatures serialized in alphanumeric order.

## Establishing a binding contract

 * One party creates an incomplete bid/ask contract and publishes on the network.
 * Prospective partner responds with signed counteroffer.
 * Counteroffers continue until both parties signed a complete contract which is then binding.
